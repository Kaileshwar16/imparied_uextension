YouTube Caption Extractor 🚀

A simple Firefox extension that grabs captions from YouTube videos and displays them in a clean popup.

Why?

Because captions aren’t just text — they can be remixed, repurposed, and extended into cooler stuff.
Think:

👐 Mapping sentences to sign language animations

🌎 Translating captions into multiple languages

🧠 Running captions through AI summarizers or sentiment analysis

🎯 Creating study notes from lectures automatically
